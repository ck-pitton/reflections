What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  It adds a hidden git folder, and enables the folder and sub-directories to be committed, and ready for version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area is used to hold the files/folder the developer wants to be included in the next commit. The working directory is the location of all the files/folder in that project. Thus the differences are that the staging area only holds files that are committed in the the next commit.

  The value of this, is that each commit can show the files the developer had changed/worked on during that commit, instead of just committing all the files, thus making it harder to debug any issues, and narrow down where the bug might have come from.

change?
