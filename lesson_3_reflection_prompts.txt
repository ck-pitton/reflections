1.  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
    work local?

      A remote repository is a good idea when collaborating with other
      developers on projects, to ensure you are all working off the same files,
      and can see each others changes being made.

2.  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
    automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

      If you are working on the files locally, and you have others
      collaborating on the project, it would continually update your files, and
      possibly remove any of the changes you've made as you may not have
      committed/pushed them yet.
