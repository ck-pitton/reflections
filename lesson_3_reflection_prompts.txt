1.  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
    work local?

      A remote repository is a good idea when collaborating with other
      developers on projects, to ensure you are all working off the same files,
      and can see each others changes being made.

2.  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
    automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

      If you are working on the files locally, and you have others
      collaborating on the project, it would continually update your files, and
      possibly remove any of the changes you've made as you may not have
      committed/pushed them yet.

3.  Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
    you use one instead of another?

    - Branches
      Branches are used to essential make copies of the master branch, so you
      can make changes to the files without having to worry about effecting the
      master branch, and when you are happy with these changes you can merge it
      back into the master branch.

    - Fork
      On GitHub you can make a fork, which a copy of somebody else's repository,
      which you can make changes to without effecting the original owners
      repository.

    - Clones
      If you wish to copy a repository found on GitHub to your local machine,
      you can do so in the terminal by cloning the repository. This sets up a
      remote to that repository, and depending on your access status to that
      repository you can now push changes to the repository on Github from you
      local machine.

4.  What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
    stored locally?

      If you going to working offline for a few hours you can fetch the latest repository from GitHub, while still working on your own local master
      branch without merging any of the differences, but still have the ability
      to refer to any changes/conflicts in the origin/master branch.

5.  How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
    and what would be harder?

      You could collaborate by all working off the same directory on a local
      server. It would be easier knowing you are working on the same files.
      But it would be difficult in that you couldn't work on the same file at
      the same time, and then just later merge the files together.
